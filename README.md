Project 3
Iâ€™m Rezarta Aliraj I was born in Tirana on October 10, 1979. I have a master degree in Informatics (M.C.A).
My aim in life is to be able to become both spiritually and professionally fulfilled and to share my enthusiasm and inspiration with the people I am surrounded with every day. Also, one of my goals is to become a successful and accomplished Freelancer so that I may build a profile which promises good work and progress. 
My dream is very much connected with two areas that shape my life most; I dream of having a happy and supporting family (I am a mom of two little boys), for whom I take all of the inspiration to do good things, and also to become a role model teacher in teaching students what matters more in life. I always strive to do these alongside with the education and the understanding that I show.
